### The contents of this repo is the solution to the following task description:

* Write a program to determine the type of a triangle

* The solution must take the three sides as input parameters and return whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

* Consider testing, validation, and possible errors.

You decide for yourself how you want to implement the solution, but a console application is sufficient.
